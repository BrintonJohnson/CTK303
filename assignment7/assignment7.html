        <h3>About the Song</h3>
          <p>I was born on May 15, 1998. At this time, the song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwEZRPkAAu8" target="_blank">"Too Close"</a> by the R&B group, Next, was number one on Billboard's Hot 100. The song was released in September 1997 and went platinum, making it the group's most well-known song. The song uses a sample from Kurtis Blow's song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIlSPkOhTc0" target="_blank">"Christmas Rappin'."</a> I think "Too Close" is basically a romantic boy band song, which is typical 90's pop music.</p>
        <h3>Other Renditions</h3>
          <p>One interesting thing about this song is that the tune kind of resurfaced in 2015 through a parody called, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcWM_1hBu_c" target="_blank">"Why You Always Lying."</a> This was a song created by Nicholas Fraser for a Vine video. The parody got very popular in 2015 on the internet, so that's what I know the "Too Close" tune from. I didn't know the parody sampled another song until I heard "Too Close" for this assignment.</p>
